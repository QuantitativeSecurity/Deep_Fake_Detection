Deepfake Detection and Broadcasting Tool

This script captures video frames from a camera, checks if they are deepfakes using a deepfake detection model, and broadcasts the genuine frames to specified IP addresses.
Description

The script performs the following operations:

    Connects to specified IP addresses using sockets.
    Captures video frames from the default camera using OpenCV.
    Uses the deepfake_detection_toolkit to check if a frame is a deepfake.
    If the frame is genuine (not a deepfake), it encodes the frame as a JPEG and broadcasts it to the connected IP addresses.
    Continuously reads and broadcasts frames until all connections are lost or the script is manually stopped.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    OpenCV (cv2)
    deepfake_detection_toolkit (as fd in the script)
    numpy
    socket (included in the Python standard library)

Setup

    Install the required libraries:

    bash

    pip install opencv-python deepfake_detection_toolkit numpy

    Replace the placeholders 'X.X.X.X' in the ip_addresses list with the actual IP addresses you want to broadcast to.

    Ensure the target IP addresses are listening on port 12345 (or change the port in the script as needed).

Usage

    Run the script:

    bash

    python3 deepfake_detection_broadcast.py

    Expected Output:
        The script will attempt to connect to the specified IP addresses.
        It will capture video frames from the default camera, check if they are deepfakes, and broadcast the genuine frames to the connected IP addresses.
        If a connection error occurs or all connections are lost, the script will print an error message and may exit.

Note

    Ensure that the target IP addresses are set up to receive the broadcasted frames.
    The deepfake detection model and toolkit used in this script are placeholders. Ensure you have the correct implementation or library for deepfake detection.
